The engine create thread for Render, Audio, Collision

Because in the window created is where the graphics shows, all code need to be executed in the Render thread

All models are loaded in "array_models_loaded"

##Adding new model to scene
For adding new model you need to call "add_element_with_model_path"
this is necesesary for show model in the editor o game

Filling the model for test occullion happend in "update_per_frame_component" function
For render object in scene the engine fill "models_for_test_occlusion" array
After that a function "test occlusion" is called and fill "frame_draw_static_elements" array
