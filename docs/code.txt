The engine create thread for Render, Audio, Collision

Because in the window created is where the graphics shows, all code need to be executed in the Render thread

All models are loaded in "array_models_loaded"

##Shaders
Shader need to use all varing, othercase they will show Uniform Not found

##Adding new model to scene
For adding new model you need to call "add_element_with_model_path()"
this is necesesary for show model in the editor o game

Filling the model for test occullion happend in "update_per_frame_component" function
For render object in scene the engine fill "models_for_test_occlusion" array
After that a function "test occlusion" is called and fill "frame_draw_static_elements" array


##Game engine initialition
First call engine_init()
-Global variables initialization
-Global array initialization and general engine data

Second call render_thread_init() 
-here is when standart shader are called for compilation


##Game engine draw
Engine Init --> render thread definition --> draw windows --> pe_frame_draw()

##Creating geometry
Create a "Vertex" struct with vertex data, then add to the vertex_array and finily create the graphics buffer of that geometry.


## Elements
In PavonEngine the gameobjects are called Elements
Every elements can have componenets
TransformComponent have the transformation values of the elements like Scale , Position and Rotation
StaticMeshComponent have the mesh for rendering
SkinnedMeshComponent have the mesh and bones for animations purposes
